## üéØ General Questions

### What is CycleStark?

CycleStark is a decentralized platform built on Starknet that enables cyclical funding through collectives. It's a modern implementation of rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) using blockchain technology.

### How does CycleStark work?

1. **Heroes** (users) join **collectives** (funding groups)
2. Each collective has a fixed **cycle amount** and **hero count**
3. Heroes contribute the cycle amount each cycle
4. One hero receives the entire pool each cycle
5. The process rotates until all heroes receive funding

### What is a ROSCA?

A ROSCA (Rotating Savings and Credit Association) is a traditional financial system where a group of people contribute money regularly, and each member receives the entire pool once during the cycle. CycleStark modernizes this concept using blockchain technology.

### Is CycleStark safe?

Yes, CycleStark prioritizes security through:
- Smart contract audits and formal verification
- Secure wallet integration
- Transparent and immutable operations
- Community-driven development
