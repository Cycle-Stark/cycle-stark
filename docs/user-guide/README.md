## üéØ Understanding CycleStark

### What is a Collective?

A **Collective** is a group of users (called "Heroes") who come together to create a cyclical funding system. Each collective has:

- **Fixed Parameters**: Cycle amount, number of heroes, token type
- **Clear Rules**: Contribution schedule, distribution order, penalties
- **Shared Purpose**: Common goal or objective for the funding

### How Cycles Work

1. **Setup Phase**: Heroes join and lock collateral
2. **Contribution Phase**: Each hero contributes the cycle amount
3. **Distribution Phase**: One hero receives the entire pool
4. **Rotation**: The process repeats until all heroes receive funds

### Example Scenario

```
Collective: "Tech Startup Fund"
- 5 Heroes
- 0.1 ETH per cycle
- ETH token

Cycle 1: All contribute 0.1 ETH ‚Üí Hero A receives 0.5 ETH
Cycle 2: All contribute 0.1 ETH ‚Üí Hero B receives 0.5 ETH
Cycle 3: All contribute 0.1 ETH ‚Üí Hero C receives 0.5 ETH
Cycle 4: All contribute 0.1 ETH ‚Üí Hero D receives 0.5 ETH
Cycle 5: All contribute 0.1 ETH ‚Üí Hero E receives 0.5 ETH
```
