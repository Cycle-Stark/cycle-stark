About Cycle Stark

During the hacker house I will be building a MaryGoRound system called Cycle stark, a system in which people create a group called a collective, and they set rules like houw much each round of fund collection will be given out by each member, the period between 1 round and next round like 7 days, the fine to be paid if one does not pay at a given point and the fine can be used as profits at the end of a given cycle. Before the first round starts, each member is required to lock a sum equal to the single round amount times number of heroes (collective member). So an amount locked = round_amount * no_of_heroes. The locking mechanism is to ensure that no member is not defrauded. Lets say hero x pays the first round and misses the rest, the locked amount will be deducted on each round to make sure that nobody goes into loss. Also the system will have blacklisting features to make sure it blacklists those who exit before the cycle is over. Once the cycle is over, one can decide to withdraw their locked assets and or leave them their for the next collective they will be joining. all payouts will go to the heroes accounts within the system and they can decide whether to withdraw or not. A reason as to why I decided to build this project, is to enable people from different backgrounds/regions to be able to help each other. I can say that, you can have $100 today another $100 tomorrow but not $1, 000 at once, and what you want to purchase is about $2, 000. So this Cycle Stark can help you have the $2, 000 at once use the sum amount and pay the $100 slowly over a period of time without taking a loan for the same. Starknet is a better environment for such a system for reduced fees, security and quick transactions.

About scholarship
This scholarship will help me in paying for the flight to and fro Instanbul and Nairobi Kenya. Also it will help me in any of the movements that I might make while at Instanbul

Contribution to starknet eco
In the starknet ecosystem I have worked with a number of Starknet developers helping them overcome the challenges they have come across while setting up their coding environment ie making sure they have got proper autocomplete by cairo-language-server on vscode, starknet-devnet is properly working and how to use it to its fully potential, using other tools from starknet foundry like sncast and snforge, using scarb, learning cairo language and writing smart contracts. I have worked with Web3Clubs (@Web3Clubs twitter) as an intern to help different developers learn and develop smart contracts using cairo. I personally have been learning cairo, overcoming different challenges with the help of cairo devs, writing helpful blog posts about Starknet (here https://livesoftwaredeveloper.com/articles/). I am also planning to release a video on how to code on cairo from beginner to advanced levels of smart contract development, frontend development of the same and deploying to both local nodes(Katana, starknet-devnet), testnet and mainnet.

Why would be best person
I have been able to build a product(though not on Mainnet) on DeFi which is a p2p non-custodial marketplace on another chain(Near) which am also working to translate to EVM compatiple. In addition, I have worked on a donation platform for EVM compatible networks called Shift a Life which was one of Ethsafari winners (Kilifi, Kenya 2023) and am currently working on Cycle Stark also under DeFi. 

As a fullstack developer, working on both sides has made have a considerable amount of knowledge and understanding on how systems operate. I am also working on my own startup called Live Software Developer Ltd that offers IT services. Furthermore with Live Software Developer Ltd, we have mentoring classes in which I take part in where we help onboard new developers by training them on the coding basics and guide them on how to learn more and to be able to choose the paths they would like to take in the future.

Mentoring is one of the things I like doing as a fullstack developer reason being it helps me to learn things that I had not learnt or taken a keen eye on and also helping others get to know something new or know something better or from a different point.
